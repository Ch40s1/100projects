// Why I used c for this? well idk because it is the mother of all modern languages
// and its fun to use hard things.
// first I need to include the stdio library so i can use printf
#include <stdio.h>

// create a function that returns an int if it succeeds. The c99 says that it needs to be this way.
// void states that it takes no arguments or input.
int main(void) {
    // prinf prints a string to stdout
    printf("Hello World!\n");
}
